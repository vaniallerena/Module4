      <!-- ***********************  ABOUT / PROFILE  *********************** -->
       <section class="home-section">
        <p>Because of my big interest in graphic design, I decided to follow a career path about my passion to improve my design skills, 
          become a professional in what I love the most, and contribute to my community.</p>
        <p>College projects like designing brochures, posters, business cards, logos, and social media posts help me to 
          polish my design skills, learn to critique my own work, and give feedback to my peers. Outside of my school work, 
          I also like to design t-shirt prints, create illustrations based on my favorite TV shows, watch Photoshop tutorials, 
          and read articles about the current trends in the graphic design industry. I also volunteer at my local church by packaging 
          food bags for our food drive.</p>
        <p>In the future, I would like to work on a design agency or work for non-profit organizations and small businesses.</p>

          <h3>Six Feet Under Poster</h3>
          <img src="images/sfu-poster.jpg" alt="Poster that features Six Feet Under's famous hearse in the desert.">
          <p>This illustration is a personal project that I completed in 3 days. Six Feet Under is one of my favorite TV
            shows, and when I finished it, I knew I wanted to design a tribute poster. The poster features the series's iconic green
          hearse moving through the desert. The illustration is a nod to the final scene of the show.</p>

          <h3>NC Zoo Flyer </h3>
          <img src="images/lemur flyer.png" alt="flyer for the North Carolina Zoo">
          <p>My second project for the Design Applications I class. The project consisted on designing a flyer for the North Carolina Zoo
            promoting a real or fictional event for all the family. I went for a lemur party, and I used friendly typefaces and language
          to capture my target audience's attention (families with children). </p>
